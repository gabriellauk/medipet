# MediPet

MediPet is a small project I've been working on in my spare time to develop my frontend skills. It uses React on the frontend and a simple Flask backend.

Live demo: https://medipet.up.railway.app

## Features

A basic CRUD web app, MediPet gives users a place to store their pet's medical data.

* Authenticate with OAuth via your Google account or instantly access a demo account populated with sample data
* Get an at-a-glance view of key data via the dashboard
* Keep track of upcoming vet appointments
* Record regular and one-off medication
* Log any changes in your pet's behaviour, weight or other symptoms
* Access your account via your desktop or a mobile device

## Technologies

* React
* TypeScript
* Flask
* SQLAlchemy
* Alembic

## Future developments

Additional features I intend to add include:

* Support for multiple pets
* Sharing pets between accounts
* Appointment reminder notifications
